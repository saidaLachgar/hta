- all missions has parent null on chose thier parent they strat to be ignored whcih means every time i need to ge total missions, i should use where parent is null
@Done add parent field
x on insert each mission i get liste of suspected related missions as a checkbox not the one that has children, when user checks one of them we update it parent to the current mission
    suspected related missions ==  missions that has parent null same date same dapartement same type

@done on delete a parent mission detach children

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- i needed to get total interrupted client per commune
> so i added a new entity where i store the total intrupted clients per each cummune (at that moment)
@Done on major changes remove all related MissionCommune and add new ones

i need to get how many times a poste intrupted
> so i added a new entity where i store poste that related to a mission so i can get sum of poste in all missions between two given dates
@done instead of add a new entity add the poste directlly to the entity


> tasks
x remove missionPoste entity
x add many to many ralationship between mission and poste
x inside team repo getPostInterruptionInfo change query to get all missions that related to a given poste as number of time a poste intrpted, 
    then get total hours of this missions as the total intrupption
    ! where it should count related missions as one (parent=null)
x check on major change, it updates related postes

--------------------------------------------------------
cuz i couldn't prevent having the error of circular.. when getting the a item tat has children, i made two groups, one for the item operation that get all fields but not children, 
and an other groupe for the collection operation that get all fields but not the parent field, and now in th listing i can get all children, and in update i can get the parent 
cuz it's a get operation, and for the details page i should use the collection operation so i get the children


x liste visits choix de mois
x teams distance
x statistiques chart re style
x fix bug postes copé
x supp parent/children mission
x are all values stored ? postes?
x in dashboard table each team has nbPostes that has been intrupted, u have to remove that properity from the entity and get it from the many to many relationship of mission/poste

-> anomalies count is broken
- visits commune wrong data
- check each statiqtic 
- new chart
- goals
