If you don't start now, you won't finish! 
But remember, to reduce pressure and your anxiety.

It's not that you lack ambition. People procrastinate even on things they love.

- Think of procrastination as a protective strategy for dealing with motivational conflicts (I'm just protecting myself from failure).

Success -> | <- Failure
           ^ 
       Stuckness

- Instead of focusing on fear, focus on why you chose to do this work
- How does this task fit with my mission? 
- How do I make it small?
